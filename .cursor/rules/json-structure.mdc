# Pattern JSON Structure

The project uses two main JSON files to store pattern data:

## [pattern_descriptions.json](mdc:pattern_descriptions.json)

Contains metadata about each pattern in a list format:

```json
{
  "patterns": [
    {
      "patternName": "agility_story",
      "description": "Generate agile user stories and acceptance criteria following agile formats.",
      "tags": ["DEVELOPMENT"]
    },
    // More patterns...
  ]
}
```

Key fields:
- `patternName`: The unique identifier for the pattern
- `description`: A short description of what the pattern does
- `tags`: Categories or labels for organizing patterns

## [pattern_extracts.json](mdc:pattern_extracts.json)

Contains the actual pattern content/template:

```json
{
  "patterns": [
    {
      "patternName": "agility_story",
      "pattern_extract": "# IDENTITY and PURPOSE\n\nYou are an expert in the Agile framework..."
    },
    // More patterns...
  ]
}
```

When modifying the export script, you'll need to handle both files and understand how they relate to each other (patterns in both files share the same "patternName" identifier).
