# Fixing the Themes Fabric Export Script

The [themes_fabric_export.py](mdc:themes_fabric_export.py) script needs to be updated to handle the list structure in the [pattern_descriptions.json](mdc:pattern_descriptions.json) file.

## Current Issue

The script expects each pattern to be a dictionary with keys like 'title', 'tags', 'description', etc. However, the JSON file has a different structure with a "patterns" array containing objects with "patternName", "description", and "tags" fields.

## Solution Approach

The script needs to be modified to:

1. Extract the "patterns" array from the loaded JSON
2. Loop through each pattern object in the array
3. Map the fields correctly (e.g., "patternName" â†’ "title")
4. Create a file for each pattern using its "patternName" value

## Code Changes Needed

- In the `batch_export_from_json` function, extract the patterns array
- Modify how patterns are accessed and iterated
- Update the field names used in `export_pattern_to_markdown`
- Handle any missing fields gracefully

After fixing, the script should be able to process the existing JSON structure without requiring changes to the data files.

# Export Script Fix

## Problem
[themes_fabric_export.py](mdc:themes_fabric_export.py) fails because it tries to use dictionary methods on list data.

## Fix
Update `batch_export_from_json()`:
```python
def batch_export_from_json(json_path: Path):
    with open(json_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    
    patterns = data.get("patterns", [])
    
    for pattern in patterns:
        name = pattern.get("patternName", "untitled")
        export_pattern_to_markdown(pattern, name)
```

Update `export_pattern_to_markdown()`:
```python
def export_pattern_to_markdown(pattern: dict, filename: str):
    # Use patternName instead of title
    title = pattern.get("patternName", "Untitled")
    # Rest of function remains similar
```
